# Y.Music Preferences Analysis

## Introduction

In this proejct, I was tasked with analyzing customer behavior for Y.Music, focusing on the music preferences of listeners in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. This project involves formulating and testing hypotheses to understand user activity and genre preferences, enabling data-driven business decisions.

The analysis uses real data from Y.Music to compare user behavior in the two cities and test key assumptions about their listening habits.

## Objective

The main objective is to test the following hypotheses:

1. **User activity varies depending on the day and city.**
2. **On Monday mornings, residents of Springfield and Shelbyville listen to different genres. This also applies to Friday nights.**
3. **Listeners in Springfield and Shelbyville have distinct music preferences:**
   - In Springfield, users prefer pop music.
   - In Shelbyville, rap music has more fans.

## Stages

The project consists of the following stages:

1. **Data Review**:  
   Evaluate the `music_project_en.csv` dataset to assess its quality and identify any potential issues.
   
2. **Data Pre-Processing**:  
   Clean and prepare the data by addressing significant problems such as missing or inconsistent values.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:  
   Use statistical methods to validate or reject the hypotheses and derive actionable insights.

## Dataset

- **Filename**: `music_project_en.csv`  
- **Contents**: Real data on user behavior, focusing on music preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy (for hypothesis testing)

## Project Structure

1. `Data Review`: Initial exploration of the dataset.  
2. `Data Pre-Processing`: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.  
3. `Hypothesis Testing`: Statistical analysis to validate hypotheses.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure the dataset (`music_project_en.csv`) is in the same folder as the project file.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the code in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Conclusion

This project enables Y.Music to gain insights into customer behavior in Springfield and Shelbyville by analyzing activity patterns and genre preferences. The findings will help inform strategic decisions and enhance user engagement.
