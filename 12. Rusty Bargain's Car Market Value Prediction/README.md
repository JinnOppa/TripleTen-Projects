# Optimizing Car Market Value Predictions for Rusty Bargain

## Introduction

Rusty Bargain, a used car dealership, aims to improve its pricing strategy by predicting the market value of used cars accurately. The goal is to optimize pricing decisions, ensuring competitiveness in the market while maximizing profitability. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to estimate the market value of cars based on various attributes, enabling Rusty Bargain to set the right price and boost sales.

### Aim:
The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the market value of used cars based on historical sales data and various car attributes. This model will help the dealership set competitive prices and reduce the risk of underpricing or overpricing vehicles.

### Objectives:
- **Build a Predictive Regression Model**: Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on attributes such as model year, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant features.
  
- **Achieve High Predictive Accuracy**: The target for model performance is to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) and maximize R-squared, ensuring that the model can make accurate price predictions.

- **Evaluate Model Performance**: Assess the performance of multiple models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, and others to determine the best-performing model for price prediction.

- **Optimize Model Performance**: Use hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy, ensuring that the predictions are as reliable as possible.

The project aims to develop a system that enables Rusty Bargain to optimize its car pricing strategy, thereby improving sales and profitability.

## Data Description

The analysis uses a dataset containing various features related to car listings. Key features include:

- **`CarID`**: Unique identifier for the car.
- **`Make`**: Car brand.
- **`Model`**: Car model.
- **`Year`**: Year of manufacture.
- **`Mileage`**: Total mileage driven by the car.
- **`FuelType`**: Type of fuel the car uses.
- **`Transmission`**: Type of transmission (automatic, manual).
- **`Color`**: Car color.
- **`Price`**: Market value of the car (target variable).

This dataset contains **354369 entries** and **16 features**, with `Price` as the target variable to predict.

## Project Workflow

### 1. Import Libraries and Dataset
- Import necessary libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, etc.
- Load the dataset and perform basic data exploration (e.g., check for missing values and data types).

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Analysis
- Clean the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between features and visualize data distributions.

### 3. Model Building
- **Split Dataset**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Train Model**: Train various regression models including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regression**
  - **Gradient Boosting Regression**
  - **Support Vector Regression**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression**
  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use grid search or random search to optimize hyperparameters for the models.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measure the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - **R-squared**: Assess the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.
  - **Other Regression Metrics**: Such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for a comprehensive evaluation.

### 5. Conclusion
- Summarize the findings, including which model performed best based on MSE and R-squared.
- Provide recommendations for pricing strategies based on the model's predictions.
