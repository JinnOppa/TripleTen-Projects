# Zuber Ride-Sharing Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing taxi trip data in Chicago, focusing on two main objectives: **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Hypothesis Testing**. The EDA phase utilizes two datasets: one containing the number of trips completed by various taxi companies, and another detailing the average trips ending at specific drop-off locations across the city. The aim is to explore these datasets, identify patterns, and create visualizations to highlight the top-performing taxi companies and the most popular drop-off locations, providing insights into Chicago's taxi trip dynamics.

In the **Hypothesis Testing** phase, the analysis focuses on a dataset containing trip details between the Loop and Oâ€™Hare International Airport. The objective is to determine whether the average trip duration changes on Saturdays when it rains. This involves formulating null and alternative hypotheses, selecting a significance level, applying statistical tests, and interpreting the results. The project demonstrates the application of data analysis techniques, generating meaningful insights and utilizing hypothesis testing to support data-driven conclusions.

### Aim:
The goal is to explore patterns in Chicago's ride-sharing data, including analyzing taxi company performance, popular drop-off locations, and trip duration variability based on weather conditions. Additionally, this project tests the hypothesis that average trip duration on Saturdays differs when it rains.

### Objectives:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze the number of trips completed by various taxi companies in Chicago.
   - Explore the most popular drop-off locations across the city.
   - Investigate patterns related to trip durations and how they are affected by weather conditions.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Hypothesis: **Does the average trip duration change on Saturdays when it rains?**
   - Test this hypothesis using statistical methods and interpret the results.


## Data Description

The analysis will be conducted using the following datasets:

- **`moved_project_sql_result_01.csv`**: Contains the number of trips completed by various taxi companies in Chicago.
- **`moved_project_sql_result_04.csv`**: Contains average trips ending at specific drop-off locations in Chicago.
- **`moved_project_sql_result_07.csv`**: Contains trip details between the Loop and O'Hare, including weather conditions and duration of trips.

### Dataset Breakdown

#### `moved_project_sql_result_01.csv`
Contains data on taxi companies and the number of trips completed by each company. The dataset includes:
- **`company_name`**: The name of the taxi company.
- **`trips_amount`**: The number of trips completed by the company.

#### `moved_project_sql_result_04.csv`
Contains data on drop-off locations and average trips for each location in Chicago. The dataset includes:
- **`dropoff_location_name`**: The name of the drop-off location.
- **`average_trips`**: The average number of trips ending at the drop-off location.

#### `moved_project_sql_result_07.csv`
Contains trip data for the Loop to O'Hare route. The dataset includes:
- **`start_ts`**: Timestamp when the trip started.
- **`weather_conditions`**: Weather conditions during the trip (Good or Bad).
- **`duration_seconds`**: Duration of the trip in seconds.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import and Initial Exploration**
   - Import the datasets and examine the structure, data types, and check for any missing values.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean the data by handling missing values and ensuring proper data types.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyze the number of trips completed by taxi companies.
   - Explore the most popular drop-off locations in Chicago.
   - Investigate patterns in trip durations and weather conditions.

4. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Hypothesis: **Does the average trip duration change on Saturdays when it rains?**
     - Formulate null and alternative hypotheses.
     - Select significance level and apply statistical tests to the dataset.
     - Interpret the test results to support or reject the hypothesis.

5. **Visualization**
   - Create visualizations to present insights from the data analysis, including bar charts, line graphs, and box plots.

6. **Conclusion**
   - Summarize the findings and provide recommendations based on the analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** or download the project folder.
2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy
   ```
3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open the notebook and run the cells one by one to perform the analysis and generate insights.


## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into Chicago's ride-sharing data, including the performance of taxi companies, popular drop-off locations, and the impact of weather on trip durations. The results of the hypothesis testing will also shed light on whether rainy Saturdays affect ride duration.
